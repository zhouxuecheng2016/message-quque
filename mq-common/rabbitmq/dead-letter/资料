Messages from a queue can be 'dead-lettered';
that is, republished to another exchange when any of the following events occur:
(1)The message is rejected (basic.reject or basic.nack) with requeue=false,
(2)The TTL for the message expires;
(3)The queue length limit is exceeded.

Dead letter exchanges (DLXs) are normal exchanges.
They can be any of the usual types and are declared as usual.

a DLX can be defined by clients using the queue's arguments,in the server using policies.

 In the case where both policy and arguments specify a DLX, the one specified in arguments overrules the one specified in policy.

1:Configuration using arguments
To set the dead letter exchange for a queue, set the x-dead-letter-exchange argument to the name of the exchange:

channel.exchangeDeclare("some.exchange.name", "direct");
Map<String, Object> args = new HashMap<String, Object>();
args.put("x-dead-letter-exchange", "some.exchange.name");
channel.queueDeclare("myqueue", false, false, false, args);


2:Configuration using policy
