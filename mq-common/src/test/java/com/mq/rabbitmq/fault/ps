Exchanges
There are a few exchange types available: direct, topic, headers and fanout

The fanout exchange is very simple.
As you can probably guess from the name,
it just broadcasts all the messages it receives to all the queues it knows.

Listing exchanges
amq.topic           topic
amq.direct          direct
amq.rabbitmq.log    topic
amq.fanout          fanout
amq.headers         headers
                    direct
amq.rabbitmq.trace  topic
amq.match           headers

The default exchange
The empty string denotes the default or nameless exchange:
messages are routed to the queue with the name specified by routing_key, if it exists

Temporary queues
Bindings
We've already created a fanout exchange and a queue. Now we need to tell the exchange to send messages to our queue. That relationship between exchange and a queue is called a binding.

rabbitmqctl list_bindings

We need to supply a routing_key when sending, but its value is ignored for fanout exchanges.
